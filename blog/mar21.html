            Hi!
          </p>

          <p>
            So, it's pretty obvious that I did not release the archive or the video. It turns out that being an engineering
            student is actually more time consuming than I thought so I haven't really been able to put time aside to
            film or code the archive, even though the archive is roughly 50% complete.
          </p>

          <p>
            With that being said, I am going to be putting all video projects on hold until after this semester is over,
            and I will set the archive as one of the main goals to complete by the end of my semester (roughly the beginning
            of May). It seems that I am not that good at time estimates, but we will try to stick by this more realistic one.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, while coding and filming is very time consuming, Music is not. So, I am going to be throwing all of my spare
            creative juices at creating real, bonified, songs. I have about 2 instrumentals in the backlog, and I'm about to
            start a third. Eventually, either before or after the archive is done, I am going to record the vocals for each
            of the songs and spit them out rapidfire as they're finally finished. These are definetly at a much higher production
            value than any other track I have ever released, so that's pretty exciting.
          </p>

          <p>
            Anyways, videos on hold, archive and music coming soon.
          </P>

          <p>
            Bye!
