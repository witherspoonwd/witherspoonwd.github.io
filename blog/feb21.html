          <p>
            As I stated before, I am still working on my video project. I currently have the script fully written,
            However there are some delays in filming due to weather so I am putting the project on hold until I can
            film. I am really happy with the script and the concept, and I really hope you guys enjoy the video as
            well. I have huge ambitions with this project so I hope that my eyes aren't bigger than my stomach...
          </p>

          <p>
            So, for the time being, I am going to work on improving the website and developing the archive. I'm not
            sure if the archive will be finished before I can film, but I will definetly be able to do some bug fixes
            and general improvement in the meantime. Like with the video project, I have some pretty high ambitions
            that might require me learning a whole new programming language, so once again, I hope that my eyes
            aren't bigger than my stomach...
          </p>

          <p>
            But yeah! That's the plan! Expect a new blog post once the Archive is done or once filming is done.
            I think I want to have some sort of progress bar that shows how far I am into a video somewhere on here,
            but that's opening a whole other can of worms. We'll see what happens. Bye!
