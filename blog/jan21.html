          <p>
            During finals last semester, I told myself that by the end of christmas
            break I would make a video essay on an interesting part of Youtube History.
            Through finals, a large chunk of my spare time was spent doing research
            and writing this video. But when Christmas break actually started, All of
            my ambition to make the project had suddenly disappeared. Instead, I was
            suddenly filled with the unquenching thirst to actually finish the website
            that I had bought a domain for in October, in hopes of creating a hub
            for all of the art that I want to create.
          </p>

          <p>
            Needless to say, I have finally finished creating the framework for what
            I hope will become a well-used crypt for my creations. I am quite proud of
            my work but it's definitely not perfect. For one, I am not trained in
            HTML at all and I bet if a trained web developer saw my code, he would
            probably recognize it for the shoddy spaghetti code it is. But, for now,
            this will work for me. Brace yourselves for when I actually learn Javascript
            and PHP doe…
          </p>

          <p>
            Even though I think the code is at a point where I feel comfortable
            actually publishing it, I still have some more features that need to
            be added. For one, I haven’t even started on developing the archive,
            nor do I even know how it’s going to work. I don’t know if I can host
            large files from where I’m hosting this site, and I don’t know if it’s
            even worth it to do that when I can just upload my stuff on youtube/soundcloud…
            But, I will get to that eventually (after I finish work on my next project).
          </p>

          <p>
            Anyways, to summarize this first post: Website up! Yay! Still missing
            features. :/ New video project coming soon. Probably going to have
            something to do with the highway…
