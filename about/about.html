    <h1>About This Website</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to WILLWITHERSPOON.NET, the repository of all works created by
        Will Witherspoon. This website serves as an archive for all the creative
        works by Will as well as an ePortfolio and blog. Essentially,
        this website is, as the homepage states, “The hub for all things Will
        Witherspoon”.
      </p>

      <p>
        This website was made entirely from scratch and is currently being hosted
        via static HTML5 pages without JavaScript. Unfortunately, this means that
        the website doesn’t currently support mobile devices very well, but that
        will change in the future as more resources are placed into the website.
      </p>



    <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
         Hi! I’m Will Witherspoon and thanks for coming onto my website! I’m
         really excited to start posting my content here for all of you to see!
         I currently make music and videos, but I’m also developing my art skills
         and attempting a webcomic called Johnny Awesome. Outside of art and music,
         I’m also currently attending college to become a computer engineer.
         Eventually this website may come to serve as a genuine ePortfolio, but
         as of now, this will be my creative works site.
      </p>

      <p>
         I hope you stick around and look at the stuff I’ve made! Thanks!
      </p>
