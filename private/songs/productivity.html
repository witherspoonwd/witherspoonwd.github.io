  <br>
  good morning employees!<br>
  i hope you're ready for another day<br>
  of satisfying work!<br>
<br>
  in company news:<br>
  sharon has unfortuately passed away at<br>
  her office due to some sort of self-inflicted wound.<br>
  her can-do attitude and product output will be missed<br>
<br>
  HR would like to remind all employees that failure<br>
  to report suspected company property damage, including<br>
  self-harm, will be grounds for termination.<br>
<br>
  have a great and productive day everybody!<br>

  NOTE: the instrumental behind this should be very bossa novaey, but still
   similar to musak. :)
