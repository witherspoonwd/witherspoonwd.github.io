<p>[themes? about a house thats scary, not because of its foundation, but about the relationship
  between the inhabitants that it houses]
<p>
  The turpentine laced plaster<br>
  covers walls built years ago,<br>
  a certain feeling's captured<br>
  behind the steady <a href="turpentine1v.m4a">walls</a>
</p>
<p>
  inside, two lovers quarrel,<br>
  sharing words laced with venom,<br>
  their words pierce the plaster,<br>
  leaving eternal <a href="turpentine2v.m4a">scars</a>
</p>
<p>
  our love was unbroken,<br>
  but we still fucked it up.<br>
  a once tight rope unwoven,<br>
  never to function again
