  why is it so hard,<br>
  to sit down and focus.<br>
  why is it so hard to have the patience to make <a href="hardv1.m4a">something</a>.
</p>
<p>
  why is it so hard <br>
  to get through to you.<br>
  why is it so hard for us to have a healthy relationship?
</p>
<p>
  why can't you just listen to what i have to say <br>
  instead of driving me on that goose chase, far <a href="hardv2.m4a">away</a>
</p>
<p>
  why is life so hard,<br>
  why can't i sit down and have a good time<br>
  without,<br>
  thinking about the reprecussions of my<br>
  ACTIONS.
</p>
<p>
  (solo)
</p>
<p>
  why is life so easy, (bum bum ba bum)<br>
  just kidding its still so hard.
</p>
<p>
  why can't i find love,<br>
  actually i can if i try.
</p>
<p>
  why's it so hard to try?
</p>
<p>
  why can't i just go out side<br>
  and look at the sky,<br>
  and have my heart get brighter.
</p>
<p>
  instead im stuck here,<br>
  waiting for something better to come.
