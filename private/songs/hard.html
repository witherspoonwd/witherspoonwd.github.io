  to sit down and focus.

<p>
  why is it so hard to sit down and make something.<br>
</p>
<p>
  why is it so hard to get through to you.<br>
  to tell you something even though i don't want to.
</p>
<p>
  why is life so hard,<br>
  why can't i sit down and have a good time<br>
  without,<br>
  thinking about the reprecussions of my<br>
  ACTIONS.
</p>
<p>
  (solo)
</p>
<p>
  why is life so easy, (bum bum ba bum)<br>

</p>
<p>
  why can't i find love,<br>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  why can't i just go out side<br>
  and look at the sky,<br>
  and have my heart get brighter.
</p>
<p>
  instead im stuck here,<br>
  waiting for something better to come.
