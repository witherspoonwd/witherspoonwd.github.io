<p>
i wanna go outside today<br>
and spend some time away<br>
from all of the things that<br>
drive me insane

<p>
my friends will all be there,<br>
with many things to share,<br>
exchanging our pleasantries,<br>
getting impared
</p>
<p>
(2 bars of solo)
</p>
<p>
I don't care if I miss my deadlines<br>
Cuz i am finally feeling myself!<br>
you can think what you want about it,<br>
but quite frankly i don't give a fuck!
</p>
<p>
(solo)
</p>
<p>
i finaly have sone time<br>
to make things of all kinds<br>
so many possibilities<br>
so little time
</p>
<p>
but, when im finally there,<br>
with a pencil and a snare,<br>
my motivation deteriates<br>
and i just stare
</p>
<p>
(solo)
</p>
<p>
i take a hike outside where the sun will shine today<br>
feeling the nature around me makes me feel okay <br>
when the sun goes down and lights burn out,<br>
my spirits will fall again, but thatâ€™s okay because I know<br>
that the sun will rise again
</p>
<p>
spend time away<br>
another day<br>
</p>
<p>
(final solo)<br>
