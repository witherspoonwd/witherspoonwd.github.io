<p>
  i just got a creative commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International
  license.<br>
  its gonna help protect my work.<br>
</p>
<p>
  now i can finally share my Works with my friends<br>
  and enemies and coworkers and garbage man and postman<br>
  and amazon delivery driver and parental units and<br>
  politicans and climate scientists and railyard workers.
</p>
<p>
  now, when i share my work with them,<br>
  i will be able to make sure that they don't steal<br>
  my work from me and make it their own.
</p>
<p>
  the only problem with this theory,<br>
  is that i would need to purchase a<br>
  lawyer to sue them if they do.
</p>
<p>
  i do not have enough money to buy a lawyer.<br>
