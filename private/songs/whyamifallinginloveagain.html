  [verse 1]<br>
  one thought entered my mind that day,<br>
  when you told me your lover had gone away.
</p>
<p>
  affections that were repressed long ago,<br>
  have risen back up to resume the show
</p>
<p>
  now here i am feeling very confused,<br>
  because im falling once again for you-oo.
</p>
<p>
  [break]<br>
  oo-oo<br>
  woah-oh<br>
  yeah-ah<br>
  woo-hoo
</p>
<p>
  (bleep bloop bleep bleep bloop)
</p>
<p>
  [bridge]<br>
  it's been so long since i felt this feeling,<br>
  a dread that sticks like sticky hands on the ceiling,<br>
  i thought i had my feelings sorted out,<br>
  but here i am waxing love devout!
</p>
<p>
  [chorus]<br>
  why am i falling in love again? oh oh oh<br>
  why am i falling for you!?!?<br>
  why can't i just want to be your friend? oh oh oh<br>
  baby im falling for you!
</p>
<p>
  (solo solo)
