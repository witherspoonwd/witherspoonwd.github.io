  i think im getting a little bit confused...
  its been a long while since i felt this feeling...

  the first thought entered my head,
  and even though i wanted it gone,

  it stuck around.

  i thought i was over it, but i guess it wasn't.
  one interaction and i was smitten again.

  im trying to fight to be normal around you,
  but it's so hard to when im hiding my affection.

  i feel like theres no chance but i still wanna fight,
  to hold you in my arms!!

  why am i falling in love again? oh oh oh
  why am i falling for you!?!?
  why can't i just want to be your friend? oh oh oh
  baby im falling for you!
