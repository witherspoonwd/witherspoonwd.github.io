[updated 5.14.20]

i wanna go outside today
and spend some time away
from all of the things that
drive me insane

my friends will all be there,
with many things to share,
exchanging our pleasantries,
getting impared

(2 bars of solo)

I don't care if I miss my deadlines
Cuz i am finally feeling myself!
you can think what you want about it,
but quite frankly i don't give a fuck!

(solo)

i finaly have sone time
to make things of all kinds
so many possibilities
so little time

but, when im finally there,
with a pencil and a snare,
my motivation deteriates
and i just stare

(solo)

i take a hike outside where the sun will shine today
feeling the nature around me makes me feel okay 
when the sun goes down and lights burn out,
my spirits will fall again, but thatâ€™s okay because I know
that the sun will rise again

spend time away
another day
 
(final solo)
