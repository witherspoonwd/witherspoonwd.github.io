twitter:

want to attack twitter from two areas: The memetic side and the political/real issues side.

The idea of twitter:
I like the idea of being able to write little thoughts, both for personal use and for others to see.
The problem is, real issues are being discussed and it actually creates a very toxic enviroment.

Memetic side:
dont really have any problems. funny twitter is really funny.

political:

Twitter is an optics platform. There is no substantive takeaway from political twitter at all. The
most value that could be pulled out of twitter is the little "politician said this" tweets. Any other
possible argument you can pull away is useless, even if its a well thought out one. Because there is no
possible way you could justify any type of take with such small space.
